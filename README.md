A simple moving lines proof of concept for some sort of polyrhythmically moving dots on semi circle lines.

It's been made using Electron.JS, NodeJS and TypeScript. The logic behind the dots moving is simple, the dots being moved by moving the locations alternatively, the dots metting again in the starting point after a certain amount of time depending of the moving speed.

### *polyrhythm - noun* : **a rhythm which makes use of two or more different rhythms simultaneously.**
